The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -25 and +25 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 3 percent of pixels
